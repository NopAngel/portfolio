# Why HTML?

I use HTML, CSS, and JS because, ultimately, it's a landing page. 
I don't want it to be a complicated page, or to complicate my life just 
to have a simple one. Also, because a project with Astro.js (for example) has many files 
and the source code bin is quite large, meaning:

as I already mentioned, slower development and compilation.
